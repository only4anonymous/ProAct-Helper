# Proactive Agent — Training (SFT) & One-Step Planning Evaluation

This folder is a **clean, GitHub-ready export** of the core **training** and **testing** code for the Proactive Agent project.

**Important**: this repository **does not include datasets, frames, checkpoints, or proprietary assets**. The `data/` directory is intentionally empty (placeholder only).

## Repository Layout

- `train/`: SFT training code and the single runnable training script.
- `test/onestep_planning/`: One-step planning evaluation code and scripts.
- `test/detection_prediction/`: Detection / prediction evaluation helpers and test runner.
- `module_tools/TFace/recognition/README.md`: Third-party face recognition module README (with a note that data will be released in the future).
- `data/`: Placeholder directory for future data release.

## Quickstart

### Environment

Create a Python environment (3.10+ recommended) and install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Data / Paths (required)

Most training scripts are **data-agnostic** and use environment variables for paths:

- `MODEL_NAME_OR_PATH`: base model directory (e.g. a local HuggingFace model folder)
- `TRAIN_JSON`: training JSONL
- `VAL_JSON`: validation JSONL
- `FRAME_ROOT`: frame directory root
- `ANNOTATION_JSON`: annotation file (if needed by your run)
- `PRIORITY_SCORES_JSON`: priority score file (if needed by your run)

Example:

```bash
export MODEL_NAME_OR_PATH=/path/to/Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct
export TRAIN_JSON=/path/to/train.jsonl
export VAL_JSON=/path/to/val.jsonl
export FRAME_ROOT=/path/to/frames
export ANNOTATION_JSON=/path/to/all_annotations.json
export PRIORITY_SCORES_JSON=/path/to/priority_score.json
```

### Train (SFT)

Run a standard training job:

```bash
bash train/run_train.sh
```

### Detection / Prediction test

```bash
bash test/detection_prediction/run_l2_sft_test.sh
```

### Evaluate (One-Step Planning)

The main evaluator is `test/onestep_planning/eval_onestep_end2end.py`.

For cached prediction folders (entropy selector):

```bash
bash test/onestep_planning/run_eval_onestep_ours.sh
```

For LLM-based evaluation via OpenAI-compatible endpoints or Gemini, use the provided scripts under `test/onestep_planning/`.

## Notes

- **No secrets in repo**: API keys are not hardcoded; provide them via environment variables.
- **Offline mode**: Some scripts set `HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1` and `TRANSFORMERS_OFFLINE=1` by default. Override them if you want online downloads.
